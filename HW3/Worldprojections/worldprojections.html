    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">In this, I used the original maps that were provided in the data folder, followed the vodeos and used each indicated projection to change the projection code in QGIS and add description and export it.</h2>

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>it uses the Earth's center mass as the coordinate origin. Geodesists believe the error is less than 2 centimeters</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>It is a compromise projection whose graticule takes the form of an ellipse. This projection is appropriate for small-scale mapping of the world. </h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>a conformal cylindrical map projection that was originally created to display accurate compass bearings for sea travel.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel Projection</h2>
    <h3>It generally distorts shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles. The scale is constant along the equator and true along the central meridian. As with most compromise projections, Winkel Tripel exaggerates polar areas.</h3>

    <h2>Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>a map projection that shows regions that are the same size on the Earth the same size on the map but may distort the shape, angle, and/or scale.</h3>
    <a href=".//maps/54034">

    </a>
    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>The equidistant conic projection preserves distances along all meridians and two standard parallels. Shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles are all generally distorted. There is no distortion along the standard parallels.</h3>

    <h2>Azimuthal Projection</h2>
    <h3>A map projection in which a globe, as of the Earth, is assumed to rest on a flat surface onto which its features are projected.</h3>

    <h2>World Robinson Projection</h2>
    <h3>The meridians are regularly distributed curves mimicking elliptical arcs. They are concave toward the central meridian and do not intersect the parallels at right angles. The parallels are unequally distributed straight lines.</h3>

    <h2>SCAR IMW Projection</h2>
    <h3>Antartica fun looking map - an azimuthal projection drawn to show Arctic and Antarctic areas. It is based on a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis in contact with the North or South Pole. It is limited to 10 or 15 degrees from the poles.</h3>
